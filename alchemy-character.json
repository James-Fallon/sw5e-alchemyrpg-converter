At 3rd level, your Guardian Focus grants you an additional effect. When you use your Channel the Force, you choose which effect to create.\r\nSome Channel the Force effects require saving throws. When you use such an effect from this class, the DC equals your universal force save DC.\r\nYou can use this feature twice. You gain an additional use at 5th, 9th, 13th, and 17th level. You regain all expended uses when you finish a short or long rest.\r\n#### Cause Harm\r\nAs an action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force to sap the life from a hostile creature you can see within 60 feet. That creature must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes necrotic damage equal to your guardian level + your Charisma modifier (minimum of +1), or half as much on a successful one.\r\n#### Lend Aid\r\nAs a bonus action, you can expend a use of your Channel the Force and touch a beast or humanoid within 5 feet of you. That creature regains hit points equal to your guardian level + your Wisdom modifier (minimum of +1). Alternatively, if the beast or humanoid is poisoned or diseased, you neutralize the poison or disease. If more than one poison or disease afflicts the target, you neutralize one poison or disease that you know is present, or you neutralize one at random.",

You may not learn a force power of a level higher than your Max Power Level, and you may learn a force power at the same time you learn its prerequisite.\r\n#### Force Points\r\nYou have a number of force points equal to your guardian level x 2, as shown in the Force Points column of the guardian table, + your Wisdom or Charisma modifier (your choice). You use these force points to cast force powers. You regain all expended force points when you finish a long rest.\r\n#### Max Power Level\r\nMany force powers can be overpowered, consuming more force points to create a greater effect. You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Power Level column of the guardian table.\r\nYou may only cast force powers at 4th and 5th-level once. You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.\r\n#### Forcecasting Ability\r\nYour forcecasting ability varies based on the alignment of the powers you cast. You use Wisdom for light side powers, Charisma for dark side powers, and Wisdom or Charisma for universal powers (your choice). You use this ability whenever a power refers to your forcecasting ability. Additionally, you use this ability modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a force power you cast and when making an attack roll with one.\r\n___\r\n**Force save DC** = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n___\r\n**Force attack modifier** = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier\r\n___",
